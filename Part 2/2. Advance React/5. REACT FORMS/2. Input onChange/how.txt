A traditional form doesn’t update the server until a user hits “submit.” But you want to update the server any time a user enters or deletes any character.

Instructions
1.
Look at Input.js.

Can you find the bug? It’s somewhere in the render function. Scroll down once you have a guess.

There’s a self-closing tag without a forward slash! Find the missing forward slash and fill it in.

2.
Look at Input‘s render function. View the result on the screen. Try typing into the <input /> in the browser.

Once Input has been set up correctly, then you will be able to change the <h1></h1>‘s inner text by typing into the <input /> in the browser.

3.
You want to respond to any entered or deleted character in the <input /> field!

The best way to do that is by listening for a “change” event on the <input />.

Give <input /> an onChange attribute. Set onChange‘s value equal to {this.handleUserInput}. Don’t worry about the fact that there is no handleUserInput function yet - you’ll make one!
