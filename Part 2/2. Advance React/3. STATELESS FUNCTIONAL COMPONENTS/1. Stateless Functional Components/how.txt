In the code editor, take a look at GuineaPigs from the last lesson.

Notice that its instructions object only has one property: render().

When you separate a container component from a presentational component, the presentational component will always end up like this: one render() function, and no other properties.

If you have a component class with nothing but a render function, then you can rewrite that component class in a very different way. Instead of using React.Component, you can write it as a JavaScript function!

A component class written as a function is called a stateless functional component. Stateless functional components have some advantages over typical component classes. We’ll cover those advantages in this lesson.

Click on Example.js to see a stateless functional component in action.
